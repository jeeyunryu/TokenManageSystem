Use [`delay`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/delay) if you need to delay a promise.*\n\n\n## API\n\n### pDefer()\n\nReturns an `object` with a `promise` property and functions to `resolve()` and `reject()`.\n\n\n## Related\n\n- [p-lazy](https://github.com/sindresorhus/p-lazy) - Create a lazy promise that defers execution until `.then()` or `.catch()` is called\n- [Moreâ€¦](https://github.com/sindresorhus/promise-fun)\n",
