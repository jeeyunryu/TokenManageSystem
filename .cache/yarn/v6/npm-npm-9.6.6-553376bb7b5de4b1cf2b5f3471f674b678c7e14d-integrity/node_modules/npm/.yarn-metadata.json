    "readme": "# npm - a JavaScript package manager\n\n[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/npm.svg)](https://npm.im/npm)\n[![license](https://img.shields.io/npm/l/npm.svg)](https://npm.im/npm)\n[![CI - cli](https://github.com/npm/cli/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/npm/cli/actions/workflows/ci.yml)\n[![Benchmark Suite](https://github.com/npm/cli/actions/workflows/benchmark.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/npm/cli/actions/workflows/benchmark.yml)\n\n### Requirements\n\nOne of the following versions of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) must be installed to run **`npm`**:\n\n* `14.x.x` >= `14.17.0`\n* `16.x.x` >= `16.13.0`\n* `18.0.0` or higher\n\n### Installation\n\n**`npm`** comes bundled with [**`node`**](https://nodejs.org/), & most third-party distributions, by default. Officially supported downloads/distributions can be found at: [nodejs.org/en/download](https://nodejs.org/en/download)\n\n#### Direct Download\n\nYou can download & install **`npm`** directly from [**npmjs**.com](https://npmjs.com/) using our custom `install.sh` script:\n\n```bash\ncurl -qL https://www.npmjs.com/install.sh | sh\n```\n\n#### Node Version Managers\n\nIf you're looking to manage multiple versions of **`Node.js`** &/or **`npm`**, consider using a [node version manager](https://github.com/search?q=node+version+manager+archived%3Afalse&type=repositories&ref=advsearch)\n\n### Usage\n\n```bash\nnpm <command>\n```\n\n### Links & Resources\n\n* [**Documentation**](https://docs.npmjs.com/) - Official docs & how-tos for all things **npm**\n    * Note: you can also search docs locally with `npm help-search <query>`\n* [**Bug Tracker**](https://github.com/npm/cli/issues) - Search or submit bugs against the CLI\n* [**Roadmap**](https://github.com/orgs/github/projects/4247/views/1?filterQuery=npm) - Track & follow along with our public roadmap\n* [**Feedback**](https://github.com/npm/feedback) - Contribute ideas & discussion around the npm registry, website & CLI\n* [**RFCs**](https://github.com/npm/rfcs) - Contribute ideas & specifications for the API/design of the npm CLI\n* [**Service Status**](https://status.npmjs.org/) - Monitor the current status & see incident reports for the website & registry\n* [**Project Status**](https://npm.github.io/statusboard/) - See the health of all our maintained OSS projects in one view\n* [**Events Calendar**](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/embed?src=npmjs.com_oonluqt8oftrt0vmgrfbg6q6go@group.calendar.google.com) - Keep track of our Open RFC calls, releases, meetups, conferences & more\n* [**Support**](https://www.npmjs.com/support) - Experiencing problems with the **npm** [website](https://npmjs.com) or [registry](https://registry.npmjs.org)? File a ticket [here](https://www.npmjs.com/support)\n\n### Acknowledgments\n\n* `npm` is configured to use the **npm Public Registry** at [https://registry.npmjs.org](https://registry.npmjs.org) by default; Usage of this registry is subject to **Terms of Use** available at [https://npmjs.com/policies/terms](https://npmjs.com/policies/terms)\n* You can configure `npm` to use any other compatible registry you prefer. You can read more about configuring third-party registries [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/using-npm/registry)\n\n### FAQ on Branding\n\n#### Is it \"npm\" or \"NPM\" or \"Npm\"?\n\n**`npm`** should never be capitalized unless it is being displayed in a location that is customarily all-capitals (ex. titles on `man` pages).\n\n#### Is \"npm\" an acronym for \"Node Package Manager\"?\n\nContrary to popular belief, **`npm`** **is not** in fact an acronym for \"Node Package Manager\"; It is a recursive bacronymic abbreviation for **\"npm is not an acronym\"** (if the project was named \"ninaa\", then it would be an acronym). The precursor to **`npm`** was actually a bash utility named **\"pm\"**, which was the shortform name of **\"pkgmakeinst\"** - a bash function that installed various things on various platforms. If **`npm`** were to ever have been considered an acronym, it would be as \"node pm\" or, potentially \"new pm\".\n",

If the\nterms of this license do not permit the full use that you propose to\nmake of the Package, you should contact the Copyright Holder and seek\na different licensing arrangement.\n\nDefinitions\n\n    \"Copyright Holder\" means the individual(s) or organization(s)\n    named in the copyright notice for the entire Package.\n\n    \"Contributor\" means any party that has contributed code or other\n    material to the Package, in accordance with the Copyright Holder's\n    procedures.\n\n    \"You\" and \"your\" means any person who would like to copy,\n    distribute, or modify the Package.\n\n    \"Package\" means the collection of files distributed by the\n    Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection and/or of\n    those files. A given Package may consist of either the Standard\n    Version, or a Modified Version.\n\n    \"Distribute\" means providing a copy of the Package or making it\n    accessible to anyone else, or in the case of a company or\n    organization, to others outside of your company or organization.\n\n    \"Distributor Fee\" means any fee that you charge for Distributing\n    this Package or providing support for this Package to another\n    party.  It does not mean licensing fees.\n\n    \"Standard Version\" refers to the Package if it has not been\n    modified, or has been modified only in ways explicitly requested\n    by the Copyright Holder.\n\n    \"Modified Version\" means the Package, if it has been changed, and\n    such changes were not explicitly requested by the Copyright\n    Holder.\n\n    \"Original License\" means this Artistic License as Distributed with\n    the Standard Version of the Package, in its current version or as\n    it may be modified by The Perl Foundation in the future.\n\n    \"Source\" form means the source code, documentation source, and\n    configuration files for the Package.\n\n    \"Compiled\" form means the compiled bytecode, object code, binary,\n    or any other form resulting from mechanical transformation or\n    translation of the Source form.\n\n\nPermission for Use and Modification Without Distribution\n\n(1)  You are permitted to use the Standard Version and create and use\nModified Versions for any purpose without restriction, provided that\nyou do not Distribute the Modified Version.\n\n\nPermissions for Redistribution of the Standard Version\n\n(2)  You may Distribute verbatim copies of the Source form of the\nStandard Version of this Package in any medium without restriction,\neither gratis or for a Distributor Fee, provided that you duplicate\nall of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.  At\nyour discretion, such verbatim copies may or may not include a\nCompiled form of the Package.\n\n(3)  You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and other\nmodifications made available from the Copyright Holder.  The resulting\nPackage will still be considered the Standard Version, and as such\nwill be subject to the Original License.\n\n\nDistribution of Modified Versions of the Package as Source\n\n(4)  You may Distribute your Modified Version as Source (either gratis\nor for a Distributor Fee, and with or without a Compiled form of the\nModified Version) provided that you clearly document how it differs\nfrom the Standard Version, including, but not limited to, documenting\nany non-standard features, executables, or modules, and provided that\nyou do at least ONE of the following:\n\n    (a)  make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder\n    of the Standard Version, under the Original License, so that the\n    Copyright Holder may include your modifications in the Standard\n    Version.\n\n    (b)  ensure that installation of your Modified Version does not\n    prevent the user installing or running the Standard Version. In\n    addition, the Modified Version must bear a name that is different\n    from the name of the Standard Version.\n\n    (c)  allow anyone who receives a copy of the Modified Version to\n    make the Source form of the Modified Version available to others\n    under\n\n        (i)  the Original License or\n\n        (ii)  a license that permits the licensee to freely copy,\n        modify and redistribute the Modified Version using the same\n        licensing terms that apply to the copy that the licensee\n        received, and requires that the Source form of the Modified\n        Version, and of any works derived from it, be made freely\n        available in that license fees are prohibited but Distributor\n        Fees are allowed.\n\n\nDistribution of Compiled Forms of the Standard Version\nor Modified Versions without the Source\n\n(5)  You may Distribute Compiled forms of the Standard Version without\nthe Source, provided that you include complete instructions on how to\nget the Source of the Standard Version.  Such instructions must be\nvalid at the time of your distribution.  If these instructions, at any\ntime while you are carrying out such distribution, become invalid, you\nmust provide new instructions on demand or cease further distribution.\nIf you provide valid instructions or cease distribution within thirty\ndays after you become aware that the instructions are invalid, then\nyou do not forfeit any of your rights under this license.\n\n(6)  You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without\nthe Source, provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect to\nthe Source of the Modified Version.\n\n\nAggregating or Linking the Package\n\n(7)  You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or\nModified Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting\naggregation provided that you do not charge a licensing fee for the\nPackage.  Distributor Fees are permitted, and licensing fees for other\ncomponents in the aggregation are permitted. The terms of this license\napply to the use and Distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions\nas included in the aggregation.\n\n(8) You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with\nother works, to embed the Package in a larger work of your own, or to\nbuild stand-alone binary or bytecode versions of applications that\ninclude the Package, and Distribute the result without restriction,\nprovided the result does not expose a direct interface to the Package.\n\n\nItems That are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version\n\n(9) Works (including, but not limited to, modules and scripts) that\nmerely extend or make use of the Package, do not, by themselves, cause\nthe Package to be a Modified Version.  In addition, such works are not\nconsidered parts of the Package itself, and are not subject to the\nterms of this license.\n\n\nGeneral Provisions\n\n(10)  Any use, modification, and distribution of the Standard or\nModified Versions is governed by this Artistic License. By using,\nmodifying or distributing the Package, you accept this license. Do not\nuse, modify, or distribute the Package, if you do not accept this\nlicense.\n\n(11)  If your Modified Version has been derived from a Modified\nVersion made by someone other than you, you are nevertheless required\nto ensure that your Modified Version complies with the requirements of\nthis license.\n\n(12)  This license does not grant you the right to use any trademark,\nservice mark, tradename, or logo of the Copyright Holder.\n\n(13)  This license includes the non-exclusive, worldwide,\nfree-of-charge patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell,\nsell, import and otherwise transfer the Package with respect to any\npatent claims licensable by the Copyright Holder that are necessarily\ninfringed by the Package. If you institute patent litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim) against any party alleging\nthat the Package constitutes direct or contributory patent\ninfringement, then this Artistic License to you shall terminate on the\ndate that such litigation is filed.\n\n(14)  Disclaimer of Warranty:\nTHE PACKAGE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER AND CONTRIBUTORS \"AS\nIS' AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES.
