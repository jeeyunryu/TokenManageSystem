One of\nthe intended uses is to sign and verify npm packages but it can be used to sign\nand verify any file.\n\n## Features\n\n* Support for signing using an OpenID Connect identity\n* Support for publishing signatures to a [Rekor][1] instance\n* Support for verifying Sigstore bundles\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- Node.js version >= 14.17.0\n\n## Installation\n\n```\nnpm install sigstore\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n```javascript\nconst { sigstore } = require('sigstore')\n```\n\n```javascript\nimport { sigstore } from 'sigstore'\n```\n\n### sign(payload[, options])\n\nGenerates a Sigstore signature for the supplied payload. Returns a\n[Sigstore bundle][2] containing the signature and the verification material\nnecessary to verify the signature.\n\n* `payload` `<Buffer>`: The bytes of the artifact to be signed.\n* `options` `<Object>`\n  * `fulcioURL` `<string>`: The base URL of the Fulcio instance to use for retrieving the signing certificate. Defaults to `'https://fulcio.sigstore.dev'`.\n  * `rekorURL` `<string>`: The base URL of the Rekor instance to use when adding the signature to the transparency log. Defaults to `'https://rekor.sigstore.dev'`.\n  * `identityToken` `<string>`: The OIDC token identifying the signer. If no explicit token is supplied, an attempt will be made to retrieve one from the environment.\n\n### attest(payload, payloadType[, options])\n\nGenerates a Sigstore signature for the supplied in-toto statement. Returns a\n[Sigstore bundle][2] containing the [DSSE][3]-wrapped statement and signature\nas well as the verification material necessary to verify the signature.\n\n* `payload` `<Buffer>`: The bytes of the statement to be signed.\n* `payloadType` `<string>`: MIME or content type describing the statement to be signed.\n* `options` `<Object>`\n  * `fulcioURL` `<string>`: The base URL of the Fulcio instance to use for retrieving the signing certificate. Defaults to `'https://fulcio.sigstore.dev'`.\n  * `rekorURL` `<string>`: The base URL of the Rekor instance to use when adding the signature to the transparency log. Defaults to `'https://rekor.sigstore.dev'`.\n  * `identityToken` `<string>`: The OIDC token identifying the signer. If no explicit token is supplied, an attempt will be made to retrieve one from the environment.\n\n\n### verify(bundle[, payload][, options])\n\nVerifies the signature in the supplied bundle.\n\n* `bundle` `<Bundle>`: The Sigstore bundle containing the signature to be verified and the verification material necessary to verify the signature.\n* `payload` `<Buffer>`: The bytes of the artifact over which the signature was created. Only necessary when the `sign` function was used to generate the signature since the Bundle does not contain any information about the artifact which was signed. Not required when the `attest` function was used to generate the Bundle.\n* `options` `<Object>`\n  * `ctLogThreshold` `<number>`: The number of certificate transparency logs on which the signing certificate must appear. Defaults to `1`.\n  * `tlogThreshold` `<number>`: The number of transparency logs on which the signature must appear. Defaults to `1`.\n  * `certificateIssuer` `<string>`: Value that must appear in the signing certificate's issuer extension (OID 1.3.6.1.4.1.57264.1.1). Not verified if no value is supplied.\n  * `certificateIdentityEmail` `<string>`: Email address which must appear in the signing certificate's Subject Alternative Name (SAN) extension. Must be specified in conjunction with the `certificateIssuer` option. Takes precedence over the `certificateIdentityURI` option. Not verified if no value is supplied.\n  * `certificateIdentityURI` `<string>`: URI which must appear in the signing certificate's Subject Alternative Name (SAN) extension. Must be specified in conjunction with the `certificateIssuer` option. Ignored if the `certificateIdentityEmail` option is set. Not verified if no value is supplied.\n  * `certificateOIDs` `<Object>`: A collection of OID/value pairs which must be present in the certificate's extension list. Not verified if no value is supplied.\n  * `keySelector` `<Function>`: Callback invoked to retrieve the public key (as either `string` or `Buffer`) necessary to verify the bundle signature. Not used when the signature was generated from a Fulcio-issued signing certificate.\n    * `hint` `<String>`: The hint from the bundle used to identify the the signing key.\n\n### tuf\n\nThe `tuf` object contains utility function for working with the Sigstore TUF repository.\n\n#### getTarget(path[, options])\n\nReturns the contents of the target at the specified path in the Sigstore TUF repository.\n\n* `path` `<string>`: The [path-relative-url string](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#path-relative-url-string) that uniquely identifies the target within the Sigstore TUF repository.\n* `options` `<Object>`\n  * `tufMirrorURL` `<string>`: Base URL for the Sigstore TUF repository. Defaults to `'https://tuf-repo-cdn.sigstore.dev'`\n  * `tufRootPath` `<string>`: Path to the initial trusted root for the TUF repository. Defaults to the embedded root.\n  * `tufCachePath` `<string>`: Absolute path to the directory to be used for caching downloaded TUF metadata and targets. Defaults to a directory named \"sigstore-js\" within the platform-specific application data directory.\n\n\n### utils\n\nThe `utils` object contains a few internal utility functions. These are exposed\nto support the needs of specific `sigstore-js` consumers but should **NOT** be\nconsidered part of the stable public interface.\n\n## CLI\n\nThe `sigstore-js` library comes packaged with a basic command line interface\nfor testing and demo purposes. However, the CLI should **NOT** be considered\npart of the stable interface of the library. If you require a production-ready\nSigstore CLI, we recommend you use [`cosign`][4].\n\n```shell\n$ npx sigstore help\nsigstore <command> <artifact>\n\n  Usage:\n\n  sigstore sign         sign an artifact\n  sigstore attest       sign an artifact using dsse (Dead Simple Signing Envelope)\n  sigstore verify       verify an artifact\n  sigstore version      print version information\n  sigstore help         print help information\n```\n\n## Credential Sources\n\n### GitHub Actions\n\nIf sigstore-js detects that it is being executed on GitHub Actions, it will use `ACTIONS_ID_TOKEN_REQUEST_URL`\nand `ACTIONS_ID_TOKEN_REQUEST_TOKEN` environment variables to request an OIDC token with the correct scope.\n\nNote: the `id_token: write` permission must be granted to the GitHub Action Job.\n\nSee https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments/about-security-hardening-with-openid-connect\nfor more details.\n\n### Environment Variables\n\nIf the `SIGSTORE_ID_TOKEN` environment variable is set, it will use this to authenticate to Fulcio.\nIt is the callers responsibility to make sure that this token has the correct scopes.\n\n### Interactive Flow\n\nIf sigstore-js cannot detect ambient credentials, then it will prompt the user to go through the\ninteractive flow.\n\n## Development\n\n### Changesets\nIf you are contributing a user-facing or noteworthy change that should be added to the changelog, you should include a changeset with your PR by running the following command:\n\n```console\nnpx changeset add\n```\n\nFollow the prompts to specify whether the change is a major, minor or patch change. This will create a file in the `.changesets` directory of the repo. This change should be committed and included with your PR.\n\n### Updating Rekor Types\n\nUpdate the git `REF` in `hack/generate-rekor-types` from the [sigstore/rekor][1] repository.\n\nGenerate TypeScript types (should update files in scr/types/rekor/\\_\\_generated\\_\\_):\n\n```\nnpm run codegen:rekor\n```\n\n### Release Steps\n\nWhenever a new changeset is merged to the \"main\" branch, the `release` workflow will open a PR (or append to the existing PR if one is already open) with the all of the pending changesets.\n\nPublishing a release simply requires that you approve/merge this PR. This will trigger the publishing of the package to the npm registry and the creation of the GitHub release.\n\n## Licensing\n\n`sigstore-js` is licensed under the Apache 2.0 License.\n\n## Contributing\n\nSee [the contributing docs][7] for details.\n\n## Code of Conduct\nEveryone interacting with this project is expected to follow the [sigstore Code of Conduct][8].\n\n## Security\n\nShould you discover any security issues, please refer to sigstore's [security process][9].\n\n## Info\n\n`sigstore-js` is developed as part of the [`sigstore`][6] project.\n\nWe also use a [slack channel][10]!
