    "readme": "WebSocket Client & Server Implementation for Node\n=================================================\n\n[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/websocket.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/websocket)\n\n[![NPM Downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/websocket.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/websocket)\n\n[ ![Codeship Status for theturtle32/WebSocket-Node](https://codeship.com/projects/70458270-8ee7-0132-7756-0a0cf4fe8e66/status?branch=master)](https://codeship.com/projects/61106)\n\nOverview\n--------\nThis is a (mostly) pure JavaScript implementation of the WebSocket protocol versions 8 and 13 for Node.  There are some example client and server applications that implement various interoperability testing protocols in the \"test/scripts\" folder.\n\n\nDocumentation\n=============\n\n[You can read the full API documentation in the docs folder.](docs/index.md)\n\n\nChangelog\n---------\n\n***Current Version: 1.0.34*** - Release 2021-04-14\n\n* Updated browser shim to use the native `globalThis` property when available. See [this MDN page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/globalThis) for context. Resolves [#415](https://github.com/theturtle32/WebSocket-Node/issues/415)\n\n[View the full changelog](CHANGELOG.md)\n\nBrowser Support\n---------------\n\nAll current browsers are fully supported.\n\n* Firefox 7-9 (Old) (Protocol Version 8)\n* Firefox 10+ (Protocol Version 13)\n* Chrome 14,15 (Old) (Protocol Version 8)\n* Chrome 16+ (Protocol Version 13)\n* Internet Explorer 10+ (Protocol Version 13)\n* Safari 6+ (Protocol Version 13)\n\nBenchmarks\n----------\nThere are some basic benchmarking sections in the Autobahn test suite.  I've put up a [benchmark page](http://theturtle32.github.com/WebSocket-Node/benchmarks/) that shows the results from the Autobahn tests run against AutobahnServer 0.4.10, WebSocket-Node 1.0.2, WebSocket-Node 1.0.4, and ws 0.3.4.\n\n(These benchmarks are quite a bit outdated at this point, so take them with a grain of salt. Anyone up for running new benchmarks? I'll link to your report.)\n\nAutobahn Tests\n--------------\nThe very complete [Autobahn Test Suite](http://autobahn.ws/testsuite/) is used by most WebSocket implementations to test spec compliance and interoperability.\n\n- [View Server Test Results](http://theturtle32.github.com/WebSocket-Node/test-report/servers/)\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nIn your project root:\n\n    $ npm install websocket\n  \nThen in your code:\n\n```javascript\nvar WebSocketServer = require('websocket').server;\nvar WebSocketClient = require('websocket').client;\nvar WebSocketFrame  = require('websocket').frame;\nvar WebSocketRouter = require('websocket').router;\nvar W3CWebSocket = require('websocket').w3cwebsocket;\n```\n\nCurrent Features:\n-----------------\n- Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0\n- Protocol version \"8\" and \"13\" (Draft-08 through the final RFC) framing and handshake\n- Can handle/aggregate received fragmented messages\n- Can fragment outgoing messages\n- Router to mount multiple applications to various path and protocol combinations\n- TLS supported for outbound connections via WebSocketClient\n- TLS supported for server connections (use https.createServer instead of http.createServer)\n  - Thanks to [pors](https://github.com/pors) for confirming this!\n- Cookie setting and parsing\n- Tunable settings\n  - Max Receivable Frame Size\n  - Max Aggregate ReceivedMessage Size\n  - Whether to fragment outgoing messages\n  - Fragmentation chunk size for outgoing messages\n  - Whether to automatically send ping frames for the purposes of keepalive\n  - Keep-alive ping interval\n  - Whether or not to automatically assemble received fragments (allows application to handle individual fragments directly)\n  - How long to wait after sending a close frame for acknowledgment before closing the socket.\n- [W3C WebSocket API](http://www.w3.org/TR/websockets/) for applications running on both Node and browsers (via the `W3CWebSocket` class). \n\n\nKnown Issues/Missing Features:\n------------------------------\n- No API for user-provided protocol extensions.\n\n\nUsage Examples\n==============\n\nServer Example\n--------------\n\nHere's a short example showing a server that echos back anything sent to it, whether utf-8 or binary.\n\n```javascript\n#!/usr/bin/env node\nvar WebSocketServer = require('websocket').server;\nvar http = require('http');\n\nvar server = http.createServer(function(request, response) {\n    console.log((new Date()) + ' Received request for ' + request.url);\n    response.writeHead(404);\n    response.end();\n});\nserver.listen(8080, function() {\n    console.log((new Date()) + ' Server is listening on port 8080');\n});\n\nwsServer = new WebSocketServer({\n    httpServer: server,\n    // You should not use autoAcceptConnections for production\n    // applications, as it defeats all standard cross-origin protection\n    // facilities built into the protocol and the browser.  You should\n    // *always* verify the connection's origin and decide whether or not\n    // to accept it.\n    autoAcceptConnections: false\n});\n\nfunction originIsAllowed(origin) {\n  // put logic here to detect whether the specified origin is allowed.\n  return true;\n}\n\nwsServer.on('request', function(request) {\n    if (!originIsAllowed(request.origin)) {\n      // Make sure we only accept requests from an allowed origin\n      request.reject();\n      console.log((new Date()) + ' Connection from origin ' + request.origin + ' rejected.');\n      return;\n    }\n    \n    var connection = request.accept('echo-protocol', request.origin);\n    console.log((new Date()) + ' Connection accepted.');\n    connection.on('message', function(message) {\n        if (message.type === 'utf8') {\n            console.log('Received Message: ' + message.utf8Data);\n            connection.sendUTF(message.utf8Data);\n        }\n        else if (message.type === 'binary') {\n            console.log('Received Binary Message of ' + message.binaryData.length + ' bytes');\n            connection.sendBytes(message.binaryData);\n        }\n    });\n    connection.on('close', function(reasonCode, description) {\n        console.log((new Date()) + ' Peer ' + connection.remoteAddress + ' disconnected.');\n    });\n});\n```\n\nClient Example\n--------------\n\nThis is a simple example client that will print out any utf-8 messages it receives on the console, and periodically sends a random number.\n\n*This code demonstrates a client in Node.js, not in the browser*\n\n```javascript\n#!/usr/bin/env node\nvar WebSocketClient = require('websocket').client;\n\nvar client = new WebSocketClient();\n\nclient.on('connectFailed', function(error) {\n    console.log('Connect Error: ' + error.toString());\n});\n\nclient.on('connect', function(connection) {\n    console.log('WebSocket Client Connected');\n    connection.on('error', function(error) {\n        console.log(\"Connection Error: \" + error.toString());\n    });\n    connection.on('close', function() {\n        console.log('echo-protocol Connection Closed');\n    });\n    connection.on('message', function(message) {\n        if (message.type === 'utf8') {\n            console.log(\"Received: '\" + message.utf8Data + \"'\");\n        }\n    });\n    \n    function sendNumber() {\n        if (connection.connected) {\n            var number = Math.round(Math.random() * 0xFFFFFF);\n            connection.sendUTF(number.toString());\n            setTimeout(sendNumber, 1000);\n        }\n    }\n    sendNumber();\n});\n\nclient.connect('ws://localhost:8080/', 'echo-protocol');\n```\n\nClient Example using the *W3C WebSocket API*\n--------------------------------------------\n\nSame example as above but using the [W3C WebSocket API](http://www.w3.org/TR/websockets/).\n\n```javascript\nvar W3CWebSocket = require('websocket').w3cwebsocket;\n\nvar client = new W3CWebSocket('ws://localhost:8080/', 'echo-protocol');\n\nclient.onerror = function() {\n    console.log('Connection Error');\n};\n\nclient.onopen = function() {\n    console.log('WebSocket Client Connected');\n\n    function sendNumber() {\n        if (client.readyState === client.OPEN) {\n            var number = Math.round(Math.random() * 0xFFFFFF);\n            client.send(number.toString());\n            setTimeout(sendNumber, 1000);\n        }\n    }\n    sendNumber();\n};\n\nclient.onclose = function() {\n    console.log('echo-protocol Client Closed');\n};\n\nclient.onmessage = function(e) {\n    if (typeof e.data === 'string') {\n        console.log(\"Received: '\" + e.data + \"'\");\n    }\n};\n```\n    \nRequest Router Example\n----------------------\n\nFor an example of using the request router, see `libwebsockets-test-server.js` in the `test` folder.\n\n\nResources\n---------\n\nA presentation on the state of the WebSockets protocol that I gave on July 23, 2011 at the LA Hacker News meetup.
