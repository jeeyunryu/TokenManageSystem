    "readme": "# React Router\n\nThe `react-router` package is the heart of [React Router](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router) and provides all\nthe core functionality for both\n[`react-router-dom`](/packages/react-router-dom)\nand\n[`react-router-native`](/packages/react-router-native).\n\nIf you're using React Router, you should never `import` anything directly from\nthe `react-router` package, but you should have everything you need in either\n`react-router-dom` or `react-router-native`. Both of those packages re-export\neverything from `react-router`.\n\nIf you'd like to extend React Router and you know what you're doing, you should\nadd `react-router` **as a peer dependency, not a regular dependency** in your\npackage.\n",
