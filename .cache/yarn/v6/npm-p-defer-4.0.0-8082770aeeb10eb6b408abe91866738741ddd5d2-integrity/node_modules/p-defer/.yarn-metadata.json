Use [`delay`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/delay) if you need to delay a promise.*\n\n## API\n\n### pDefer()\n\nReturns an `object` with a `promise` property and functions to `resolve()` and `reject()`.\n\n## Related\n\n- [p-lazy](https://github.com/sindresorhus/p-lazy) - Create a lazy promise that defers execution until `.then()` or `.catch()` is called\n- [Moreâ€¦](https://github.com/sindresorhus/promise-fun)\n\n---\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n\t<b>\n\t\t<a href=\"https://tidelift.com/subscription/pkg/npm-p-defer?utm_source=npm-p-defer&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=readme\">Get professional support for this package with a Tidelift subscription</a>\n\t</b>\n\t<br>\n\t<sub>\n\t\tTidelift helps make open source sustainable for maintainers while giving companies<br>assurances about security, maintenance, and licensing for their dependencies.\n\t</sub>\n</div>\n",
