You can either call `loadGapiInsideDOM` to load the gapi-script inside a `<script>` tag on your browser. Or use the static gapi value that was copied from [google api platform](https://apis.google.com/js/platform.js), pasted to this project and exported as `gapi`.\n\n## ðŸš€ Usage\nAdd the package to your project:\n\n```javascript\n// npm\nnpm install --save gapi-script\n\n\n// yarn\nyarn add gapi-script\n```\n\nYou can load gapi with two different approaches\n1 - import `gapi` where you need it:\n```javascript\nimport { gapi } from 'gapi-script';\n```\n\n2 - import `gapi` and called somewhere in your app:\n```javascript\nimport { loadGapiInsideDOM } from 'gapi-script';\nconst gapi = await loadGapiInsideDOM();\n```\n**After gapi loaded using the 2 approach you can access it on `window.gapi` anywhere in your app**\n\nOnce you have gapi you can use it in other functions to make your life easier\n\nIf you need to use `gapi auth2` the package already has a function to initialize it:\n\n```javascript\nimport { loadAuth2, loadAuth2WithProps, loadClientAuth2 } from 'gapi-script';\n\nlet auth2 = await loadAuth2(gapi, clientId, scopes);\n\n// or if you need to use more props from gapi you can use this method:\nlet auth2 = await loadAuth2WithProps(gapi, { /* object with props from gapi */ });\n\n// if you want to use the gapi client itself\nlet gapiClient = loadClientAuth2(gapi, clientId, scopes);\n```\n\n## ðŸ“¦ Contribution\nIf you want to contribute just open an issue and send your PR with a good description about it.\n\n**OBS**: the gapi code is copied from this link [google api platform](https://apis.google.com/js/platform.js), and can become outdated any time. I'll dedicate myself to keep it updated always, but if you see any error with gapi load, please open an issue to report about it\n",
