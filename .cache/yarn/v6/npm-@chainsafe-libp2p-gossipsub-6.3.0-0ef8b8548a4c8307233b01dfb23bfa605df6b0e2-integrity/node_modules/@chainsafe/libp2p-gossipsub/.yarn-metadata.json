You can read the specification [here](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/tree/master/pubsub/gossipsub).\n\n`libp2p-gossipsub` currently implements the [`v1.1`](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/blob/master/pubsub/gossipsub/gossipsub-v1.1.md) of the spec.\n\n## Install\n\n`npm install @chainsafe/libp2p-gossipsub`\n\n## Usage\n\n```javascript\nimport { gossipsub } from '@chainsafe/libp2p-gossipsub'\n\n\nconst libp2p = await createLibp2p({\n  // ...\n  pubsub: gossipsub(options)\n});\n\nlibp2p.pubsub.addEventListener('message', (message) => {\n  console.log(`${message.detail.topic}:`, new TextDecoder().decode(message.detail.data))\n})\n\nlibp2p.pubsub.subscribe('fruit')\n\nlibp2p.pubsub.publish('fruit', new TextEncoder().encode('banana'))\n```\n\n## API\n\n### Create a gossipsub implementation\n\n```js\nconst options = {…}\nconst gossipsub = gossipsub(options)(libp2p)\n```\n\nOptions is an optional object with the following key-value pairs:\n\n- **`emitSelf`**: boolean identifying whether the node should emit to self on publish, in the event of the topic being subscribed (defaults to **false**).\n- **`gossipIncoming`**: boolean identifying if incoming messages on a subscribed topic should be automatically gossiped (defaults to **true**).\n- **`fallbackToFloodsub`**: boolean identifying whether the node should fallback to the floodsub protocol, if another connecting peer does not support gossipsub (defaults to **true**).\n- **`floodPublish`**: boolean identifying if self-published messages should be sent to all peers, (defaults to **true**).\n- **`doPX`**: boolean identifying whether PX is enabled; this should be enabled in bootstrappers and other well connected/trusted nodes (defaults to **false**).\n- **`msgIdFn`**: a function with signature `(message) => string` defining the message id given a message, used internally to deduplicate gossip (defaults to `(message) => message.from + message.seqno.toString('hex')`)\n- **`signMessages`**: boolean identifying if we want to sign outgoing messages or not (default: `true`)\n- **`strictSigning`**: boolean identifying if message signing is required for incoming messages or not (default: `true`)\n- **`messageCache`**: optional, a customized `MessageCache` instance, see the implementation for the interface.\n- **`scoreParams`**: optional, a customized peer score parameters Object.\n- **`scoreThresholds`**: optional, a customized peer score thresholds Object.\n- **`directPeers`**: optional, an array of `AddrInfo` of peers with which we will maintain direct connections.\n\nFor the remaining API, see [@libp2p/interface-pubsub](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-interfaces/tree/master/packages/interface-pubsub).\n\n## Contribute\n\nThis module is actively under development.
