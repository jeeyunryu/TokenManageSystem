    "readme": "# Pure JavaScript gRPC Client\n\n## Installation\n\nNode 12 is recommended. The exact set of compatible Node versions can be found in the `engines` field of the `package.json` file.\n\n```sh\nnpm install @grpc/grpc-js\n```\n\n## Documentation\n\nDocumentation specifically for the `@grpc/grpc-js` package is currently not available. However, [documentation is available for the `grpc` package](https://grpc.github.io/grpc/node/grpc.html), and the two packages contain mostly the same interface. There are a few notable differences, however, and these differences are noted in the \"Migrating from grpc\" section below.\n\n## Features\n\n- Clients\n- Automatic reconnection\n- Servers\n- Streaming\n- Metadata\n- Partial compression support: clients can decompress response messages\n- Pick first and round robin load balancing policies\n- Client Interceptors\n- Connection Keepalives\n- HTTP Connect support (proxies)\n\nIf you need a feature from the `grpc` package that is not provided by the `@grpc/grpc-js`, please file a feature request with that information.\n\nThis library does not directly handle `.proto` files. To use `.proto` files with this library we recommend using the `@grpc/proto-loader` package.\n\n## Migrating from [`grpc`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/grpc)\n\n`@grpc/grpc-js` is almost a drop-in replacement for `grpc`, but you may need to make a few code changes to use it:\n\n- If you are currently loading `.proto` files using `grpc.load`, that function is not available in this library. You should instead load your `.proto` files using `@grpc/proto-loader` and load the resulting package definition objects into `@grpc/grpc-js` using `grpc.loadPackageDefinition`.\n- If you are currently loading packages generated by `grpc-tools`, you should instead generate your files using the `generate_package_definition` option in `grpc-tools`, then load the object exported by the generated file into `@grpc/grpc-js` using `grpc.loadPackageDefinition`.\n- If you have a server and you are using `Server#bind` to bind ports, you will need to use `Server#bindAsync` instead.\n- If you are using any channel options supported in `grpc` but not supported in `@grpc/grpc-js`, you may need to adjust your code to handle the different behavior. Refer to [the list of supported options](#supported-channel-options) below.\n- Refer to the [detailed package comparison](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-node/blob/master/PACKAGE-COMPARISON.md) for more details on the differences between `grpc` and `@grpc/grpc-js`.\n\n## Supported Channel Options\nMany channel arguments supported in `grpc` are not supported in `@grpc/grpc-js`. The channel arguments supported by `@grpc/grpc-js` are:\n  - `grpc.ssl_target_name_override`\n  - `grpc.primary_user_agent`\n  - `grpc.secondary_user_agent`\n  - `grpc.default_authority`\n  - `grpc.keepalive_time_ms`\n  - `grpc.keepalive_timeout_ms`\n  - `grpc.keepalive_permit_without_calls`\n  - `grpc.service_config`\n  - `grpc.max_concurrent_streams`\n  - `grpc.initial_reconnect_backoff_ms`\n  - `grpc.max_reconnect_backoff_ms`\n  - `grpc.use_local_subchannel_pool`\n  - `grpc.max_send_message_length`\n  - `grpc.max_receive_message_length`\n  - `grpc.enable_http_proxy`\n  - `grpc.default_compression_algorithm`\n  - `grpc.enable_channelz`\n  - `grpc.dns_min_time_between_resolutions_ms`\n  - `grpc.enable_retries`\n  - `grpc.per_rpc_retry_buffer_size`\n  - `grpc.retry_buffer_size`\n  - `grpc.service_config_disable_resolution`\n  - `grpc-node.max_session_memory`\n  - `channelOverride`\n  - `channelFactoryOverride`\n\n## Some Notes on API Guarantees\n\nThe public API of this library follows semantic versioning, with some caveats:\n\n- Some methods are prefixed with an underscore. These methods are internal and should not be considered part of the public API.\n- The class `Call` is only exposed due to limitations of TypeScript. It should not be considered part of the public API.\n- In general, any API that is exposed by this library but is not exposed by the `grpc` library is likely an error and should not be considered part of the public API.\n- The `grpc.experimental` namespace contains APIs that have not stabilized. Any API in that namespace may break in any minor version update.\n",

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"{}\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.
