    "readme": "# @npmcli/metavuln-calculator\n\nCalculate meta-vulnerabilities from package security advisories\n\nThis is a pretty low-level package to abstract out the parts of\n[@npmcli/arborist](http://npm.im/@npmcli/arborist) that calculate\nmetavulnerabilities from security advisories.  If you just want to get an\naudit for a package tree, probably what you want to use is\n`arborist.audit()`.\n\n## USAGE\n\n```js\nconst Calculator = require('@npmcli/metavuln-calculator')\n// pass in any options for cacache and pacote\n// see those modules for option descriptions\nconst calculator = new Calculator(options)\n\n// get an advisory somehow, typically by POSTing a JSON payload like:\n// {\"pkgname\":[\"1.2.3\",\"4.3.5\", ...versions], ...packages}\n// to /-/npm/v1/security/advisories/bulk\n// to get a payload response like:\n// {\n//   \"semver\": [\n//     {\n//       \"id\": 31,\n//       \"url\": \"https://npmjs.com/advisories/31\",\n//       \"title\": \"Regular Expression Denial of Service\",\n//       \"severity\": \"moderate\",\n//       \"vulnerable_versions\": \"<4.3.2\"\n//     }\n//   ],\n//   ...advisories\n// }\nconst arb = new Aborist(options)\nconst tree = await arb.loadActual()\nconst advisories = await getBulkAdvisoryReportSomehow(tree)\n\n// then to get a comprehensive set of advisories including metavulns:\nconst set = new Set()\nfor (const [name, advisory] of Object.entries(advisories)) {\n  // make sure we have the advisories loaded with latest version lists\n  set.add(await calculator.calculate(name, {advisory}))\n}\n\nfor (const vuln of set) {\n  for (const node of tree.inventory.query('name', vuln.name)) {\n    // not vulnerable, just keep looking\n    if (!vuln.testVersion(node.version))\n      continue\n    for (const { from: dep, spec } of node.edgesIn) {\n      const metaAdvisory = await calculator.calculate(dep.name, vuln)\n      if (metaAdvisory.testVersion(dep.version, spec)) {\n        set.add(metaAdvisory)\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## API\n\n### Class: Advisory\n\nThe `Calculator.calculate` method returns a Promise that resolves to a\n`Advisory` object, filled in from the cache and updated if necessary with\nthe available advisory data.\n\nDo not instantiate `Advisory` objects directly.  Use the `calculate()`\nmethod to get one with appropriate data filled in.\n\nDo not mutate `Advisory` objects.  Use the supplied methods only.\n\n#### Fields\n\n- `name` The name of the package that this vulnerability is about\n- `id` The unique cache key for this vuln or metavuln.  (See **Cache Keys**\n  below.)\n- `dependency` For metavulns, the dependency that causes this package to be\n  have a vulnerability.  For advisories, the same as `name`.\n- `type` Either `'advisory'` or `'metavuln'`, depending on the type of\n  vulnerability that this object represents.\n- `url` The url for the advisory (`null` for metavulns)\n- `title` The text title of the advisory or metavuln\n- `severity` The severity level info/low/medium/high/critical\n- `range` The range that is vulnerable\n- `versions` The set of available versions of the package\n- `vulnerableVersions` The set of versions that are vulnerable\n- `source` The numeric ID of the advisory, or the cache key of the\n  vulnerability that causes this metavuln\n- `updated` Boolean indicating whether this vulnerability was updated since\n  being read from cache.\n- `packument` The packument object for the package that this vulnerability\n  is about.\n\n#### `vuln.testVersion(version, [dependencySpecifier]) -> Boolean`\n\nCheck to see if a given version is vulnerable.  Returns `true` if the\nversion is vulnerable, and should be avoided.\n\nFor metavulns, `dependencySpecifier` indicates the version range of the\nsource of the vulnerability, which the module depends on.  If not provided,\nwill attempt to read from the packument.  If not provided, and unable to\nread from the packument, then `true` is returned, indicating that the (not\ninstallable) package version should be avoided.\n\n#### Cache Keys\n\nThe cache keys are calculated by hashing together the `source` and `name`\nfields, prefixing with the string `'security-advisory:'` and the name of\nthe dependency that is vulnerable.\n\nSo, a third-level metavulnerability might have a key like:\n\n```\n'security-advisory:foo:'+ hash(['foo', hash(['bar', hash(['baz', 123])])])\n```\n\nThus, the cached entry with this key would reflect the version of `foo`\nthat is vulnerable by virtue of dependending exclusively on versions of\n`bar` which are vulnerable by virtue of depending exclusively on versions\nof `baz` which are vulnerable by virtue of advisory ID `123`.\n\nLoading advisory data entirely from cache without hitting an npm registry\nsecurity advisory endpoint is not supported at this time, but technically\npossible, and likely to come in a future version of this library.\n\n### `calculator = new Calculator(options)`\n\nOptions object is used for `cacache` and `pacote` calls.\n\n### `calculator.calculate(name, source)`\n\n- `name` The name of the package that the advisory is about\n- `source` Advisory object from the npm security endpoint, or a `Advisory`\n  object returned by a previous call to the `calculate()` method.\n  \"Advisory\" objects need to have:\n  - `id` id of the advisory or Advisory object\n  - `vulnerable_versions` range of versions affected\n  - `url`\n  - `title`\n  - `severity`\n\nFetches the packument and returns a Promise that resolves to a\nvulnerability object described above.\n\nWill perform required I/O to fetch package metadata from registry and\nread from cache.  Advisory information written back to cache.\n\n## Dependent Version Sampling\n\nTypically, dependency ranges don't change very frequently, and the most\nrecent version published on a given release line is most likely to contain\nthe fix for a given vulnerability.\n\nSo, we see things like this:\n\n```\n3.0.4 - not vulnerable\n3.0.3 - vulnerable\n3.0.2 - vulnerable\n3.0.1 - vulnerable\n3.0.0 - vulnerable\n2.3.107 - not vulnerable\n2.3.106 - not vulnerable\n2.3.105 - vulnerable\n... 523 more vulnerable versions ...\n2.0.0 - vulnerable\n1.1.102 - not vulnerable\n1.1.101 - vulnerable\n... 387 more vulnerable versions ...\n0.0.0 - vulnerable\n```\n\nIn order to determine which versions of a package are affected by a\nvulnerability in a dependency, this module uses the following algorithm to\nminimize the number of tests required by performing a binary search on each\nversion set, and presuming that versions _between_ vulnerable versions\nwithin a given set are also vulnerable.\n\n1. Sort list of available versions by SemVer precedence\n2. Group versions into sets based on MAJOR/MINOR versions.\n\n       3.0.0 - 3.0.4\n       2.3.0 - 2.3.107\n       2.2.0 - 2.2.43\n       2.1.0 - 2.1.432\n       2.0.0 - 2.0.102\n       1.1.0 - 1.1.102\n       1.0.0 - 1.0.157\n       0.1.0 - 0.1.123\n       0.0.0 - 0.0.57\n\n3. Test the highest and lowest in each MAJOR/MINOR set, and mark highest\n   and lowest with known-vulnerable status.  (`(s)` means \"safe\" and `(v)`\n   means \"vulnerable\".)\n\n       3.0.0(v) - 3.0.4(s)\n       2.3.0(v) - 2.3.107(s)\n       2.2.0(v) - 2.2.43(v)\n       2.1.0(v) - 2.1.432(v)\n       2.0.0(v) - 2.0.102(v)\n       1.1.0(v) - 1.1.102(s)\n       1.0.0(v) - 1.0.157(v)\n       0.1.0(v) - 0.1.123(v)\n       0.0.0(v) - 0.0.57(v)\n\n4. For each set of package versions:\n\n    1. If highest and lowest both vulnerable, assume entire set is\n       vulnerable, and continue to next set.  Ie, in the example, throw out\n       the following version sets:\n\n           2.2.0(v) - 2.2.43(v)\n           2.1.0(v) - 2.1.432(v)\n           2.0.0(v) - 2.0.102(v)\n           1.0.0(v) - 1.0.157(v)\n           0.1.0(v) - 0.1.123(v)\n           0.0.0(v) - 0.0.57(v)\n\n    2. Test middle version MID in set, splitting into two sets.\n\n           3.0.0(v) - 3.0.2(v) - 3.0.4(s)\n           2.3.0(v) - 2.3.54(v) - 2.3.107(s)\n           1.1.0(v) - 1.1.51(v) - 1.1.102(s)\n\n    3. If any untested versions in Set(mid..highest) or Set(lowest..mid),\n       add to list of sets to test.\n\n           3.0.0(v) - 3.0.2(v) <-- thrown out on next iteration\n           3.0.2(v) - 3.0.4(s)\n           2.3.0(v) - 2.3.54(v) <-- thrown out on next iteration\n           2.3.54(v) - 2.3.107(s)\n           1.1.0(v) - 1.1.51(v) <-- thrown out on next iteration\n           1.1.51(v) - 1.1.102(s)\n\nWhen the process finishes, all versions are either confirmed safe, or\nconfirmed/assumed vulnerable, and we avoid checking large sets of versions\nwhere vulnerabilities went unfixed.\n\n### Testing Version for MetaVuln Status\n\nWhen the dependency is in `bundleDependencies`, we treat any dependent\nversion that _may_ be vulnerable as a vulnerability.  If the dependency is\nnot in `bundleDependencies`, then we treat the dependent module as a\nvulnerability if it can _only_ resolve to dependency versions that are\nvulnerable.\n\nThis relies on the reasonable assumption that the version of a bundled\ndependency will be within the stated dependency range, and accounts for the\nfact that we can't know ahead of time which version of a dependency may be\nbundled.  So, we avoid versions that _may_ bundle a vulnerable dependency.\n\nFor example:\n\nPackage `foo` depends on package `bar` at the following version ranges:\n\n```\nfoo version   bar version range\n1.0.0         ^1.2.3\n1.0.1         ^1.2.4\n1.0.2         ^1.2.5\n1.1.0         ^1.3.1\n1.1.1         ^1.3.2\n1.1.2         ^1.3.3\n2.0.0         ^2.0.0\n2.0.1         ^2.0.1\n2.0.2         ^2.0.2\n```\n\nThere is an advisory for `bar@1.2.4 - 1.3.2`.  So:\n\n```\nfoo version   vulnerable?\n1.0.0         if bundled (can use 1.2.3, which is not vulnerable)\n1.0.1         yes (must use ^1.2.4, entirely contained in vuln range)\n1.0.2         yes (must use ^1.2.5, entirely contained in vuln range)\n1.1.0         if bundled (can use 1.3.3, which is not vulnerable)\n1.1.1         if bundled (can use 1.3.3, which is not vulnerable)\n1.1.2         no (dep is outside of vuln range)\n2.0.0         no (dep is outside of vuln range)\n2.0.1         no (dep is outside of vuln range)\n2.0.2         no (dep is outside of vuln range)\n```\n\nTo test a package version for metaVulnerable status, we attempt to load the\nmanifest of the dependency, using the vulnerable version set as the `avoid`\nversions.  If we end up selecting a version that should be avoided, then\nthat means that the package is vulnerable by virtue of its dependency.\n",
