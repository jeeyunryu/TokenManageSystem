    "readme": "# Truffle Codec\n\nThis module, `@truffle/codec`, provides an interface for decoding Solidity\nsmart contract state as well as information sent to or from smart contracts\nusing the Solidity ABI.  It produces output in a machine-readable form that\navoids losing any information.  It also has some rudimentary encoding\nfunctionality, that will be expanded in the future.  This module is also\nwhat Truffle Debugger uses for its decoding.\n\nThis is a low-level module, and it's probable that you should use the\nhigher-level interface [Truffle Decoder](../decoder/) instead.  That said, if\nfor whatever reason Truffle Decoder will not suffice for your use case, it's\npossible that you may need to use this.\n\n## Install\n\n```\n$ npm install --save @truffle/codec\n```\n\nThis module does not provide a CLI; it is entirely meant to be used as part\nof a larger JavaScript or TypeScript program.\n\n## Usage and Documentation\n\nThis module has some [API\ndocumentation](https://www.trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/codec/index.html),\nwhich you should see for further usage information.  Note that as this is a\nlow-level module mostly intended for internal Truffle use, its documentation is\nsparse at the moment.\n\n## License\n\nAs part of the larger [Truffle Suite](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/),\nthis module is MIT-licensed.\n",
